Karyakram Site Pack — 2025-07-30

Included files:
1) index.html  -> (rename from index_redirect_to_ENHANCED.html) redirects to Enhanced page
2) karyakram_themeA_csv_ENHANCED.html  -> Enhanced UI (search, filters, pagination, slideshow)
3) karyakram_themeA_csv_direct_FINAL.html  -> Simple final with pagination (backup)

How to deploy:
1. Upload all files to your hosting (repo root).
2. Rename `index_redirect_to_ENHANCED.html` to `index.html` (if you want the site to open the Enhanced page by default).
   - If delete/overwrite was failing earlier, just rename old index.html to index_old.html and place this new index.html.
3. Open your site root URL. It will redirect to karyakram_themeA_csv_ENHANCED.html.

Notes:
- The CSV link is already embedded. If you want to update later, open the HTML and change the value of const CSV_URL.
- If images appear broken for some items, ensure the Drive files are shared as "Anyone with the link - Viewer".
- Use Hard Refresh (Ctrl+F5) after deploy to bypass cache, or append ?v=YYYYMMDD to the URL.
